1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset - Style Prediction
3. Data processing using pandas dataframe
	- converting str to float and integer
	- Dropping or replacing the null values
4. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
	- Displaying the Outcome Label
5. Label Encoding
	- Label Encoder to Object to int
6. Feature Selection using pandas iloc
7. Splitting the data train and test 
8. Building the model
	- Matrix Factorization via LDA
	- SVM
	- Random Forest
	- Decision Tree
	- Voting Classifier - (SVC + RF + DT)

9. Training the model
10. Building the model with Voting Classifier since it gives better score around 100% comparing with Other Models 
11. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
12. Importing the packages
13. User gives input as Feature Values 
14. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
15. Trained model is used for prediction
16. Final outcome is displayed through frontend

Extension
----------

In the base paper, the author mentioned to use Machine Learning models (like MF and AI based proposed RF),in which MF got 93.48%, 
As an extension we have applied Voting Classifier,SVM and DT for analysis the data, in which Voting Classifier got 100% 
So with the Voting Classifier we build the model used for predicting the result.
